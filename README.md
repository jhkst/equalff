# equalff

**equalff** is fast equal (duplicate) files finder. It uses different algorithm than other duplicate files finders and therefore is faster then others for one run.

### Compile
To compile it simply run **make** in the project root.

### Usage
```
Usage: equalff [OPTIONS] <FOLDER> [FOLDER]...
Find duplicate files in FOLDERs according to their content.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -f, --same-fs             process files only on one filesystem
  -s, --follow-symlinks     follow symlinks when processing files
  -b, --max-buffer=SIZE     maximum memory buffer (in bytes) for files comparing
  -o, --max-of=COUNT        force maximum open files (default 16)
  -m, --min-file-size=SIZE  check only file with size grater or equal to size (default 1)
```

**Example:**
```
$ equalff ~/
```
**Result:**
```
<stderr>Looking for files ... 123 files found
<stderr>Sorting ... done.
<stderr>Starting fast comparsion.
...
<stdout>file1-location1
<stdout>file1-location2
<stdout>file1-location3
<stdout>
<stdout>file2-location1
<stdout>file2-location2
...
<stderr>Total files being processed: 123
<stderr>Total files being read: 10
<stderr>Total equality clusters: 2
```

### Advantages/Disadvantages
**Advantages**
- It's mostly really faster than others, it reads only those bytes(blocks) which are necessary.

**Disadvantages**
- It does not compute hash of file content so the result cannot be reused.
- There are some memory limits (so not suitable for tiny systems).
- It does not read last bytes in first stage of comparison, where the probability of non-equality is high. This slows down the process a little bit.
- On some filesystems (like FAT) it's not possible to open more than 16 files at once. This can be changed by **--max-of** option.
- Not tested with hardlinks and sparse files.
- Not parallelized.
- On non-SSD disks it's slower than others (that's because of file fragmentation). See [#1](https://github.com/jhkst/equalff/issues/1)

see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file

### Plans
I've plans to add selection and action features on found clusters like
"remove last modified", "remove first modified", "keep files starting on path", etc...
